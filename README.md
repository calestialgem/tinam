# Text Is Not Allowed, Mate!

A project for people who want to create TextMate grammars while keeping their
sanity.

Goal of the project is to generate TextMate files without writing a single chunk
of Regular Expression. Instead, a Java data structure is built and passed to
TextMate generator, which handles converting that data structure to bunch of
TextMate rules.
